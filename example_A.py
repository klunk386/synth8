"""
Voice Sequencing Example â€“ Play Individual Notes in Time

This example demonstrates how to trigger multiple SynthVoice instances
independently in time. Three sine wave voices corresponding to C, E, and G
are added to the SynthEngine and played in sequence to build a chord
gradually, then released after a delay.
