"""
Multi-Voice Keyboard Example â€“ Real-Time Synth Control with LFO and Filtering

This example demonstrates how to assign multiple SynthVoice instances to
different keyboard keys using SynthEngine. Each voice has its own waveform,
filter, ADSR envelope, and LFO settings. Use the 'z' and 'x' keys to trigger
the two voices in real-time.
