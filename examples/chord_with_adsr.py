"""
Example: Chord-like sound with multiple oscillators and shared ADSR.

This example creates a SynthVoice with three oscillators (C4, E4, G4),
combined into a single voice using a shared envelope and VCA.
The envelope controls the amplitude with a soft pad-like shape.

Key mapping:
    z â†’ C major chord with ADSR envelope
